          <h4>Reason for attending Altschool</h4>
        </header>
        <main>
          <p>I chose to attend Altschool primarily because of my quest to acquire valuable technology skills. I have worked as a product manager for a couple of years now and I have been a part of the building process for a couple of products and this exposure has heightened my curiosity about how these technology products are built. Hence my decision to acquire some of these skills so I can be a vauable addition to any organization I would choose to work for in the future.</p>
          <p>I also understand that as part of the Altschool learning experience, I will be exposed a diverse community of learners which will help me build some soft skills such as collaboration and personal interactions, which will be helpful in my professional journey.</p>
